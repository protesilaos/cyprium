# Cyprium syntax theme

A low-contrast colour scheme for the purposes of highlighting code syntax. *Cyprium* is inspired by the landscapes of Cyprus as they appear during the period of late spring. Yellow is the most prevalent accent, followed by orange, and green.

For the time being, Cyprium is developed specifically for the Atom text editor. It comes in light and dark variants.
